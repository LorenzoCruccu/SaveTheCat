# SaveTheCat
# by Lorenzo Cruccu and Federico Di Filitto
Game programmed in Java with Java Swing in 2019.
To open the game, use a java IDE (we used intelliJ), go to the class called "Accesso" and run the program from there.
The goal of this game is to save the cat from same really scary enemies!
You'll earn credits by killing them and you can purchase new powerful weapons from the store menu.
Every 10 levels the game will auto-save and when you restart the game, you are going to resume from your last check point.
By pressing U, the cat will help you killing all the enemies on screen for 5 long seconds.
You can have access to the in-game menu by clicking ESC. From there, you can stop the music, stop the sound or return to the main menu.
Hope you will have fun!
